  <p>The Color Page in DaVinci Resolve is a professional workspace for color correction and grading, featuring a node-based system for flexible adjustments. It offers tools like primary color wheels, advanced curves, Magic Mask for AI-assisted tracking, and over 90 Resolve FX for creative enhancements. Scopes and monitoring tools ensure precise grading, while advanced noise reduction helps clean up footage. It's ideal for both technical adjustments and creative color grading.</p>
